# CST205FinalProject

This project is a Cat Affirmation App. You get sent to the home page and when you click "Get Started," you're redirected to the cat and affirmation page, you click a button and pops up a new cat image and affirmation quote.

We are using 2 APIs, https://www.affirmations.dev, and https://api.thecatapi.com.

One pulls a random affirmation quote and a cat image/gif.

This is a flask, html application.
